			<h3>Web Applications</h3>
			<p>A web application (web app) is an application that users run through their browsers. Common examples of web applications are webmails (e.g. Google Mail, Yahoo Mail), online stores (e.g. Lazada) and social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).</p>
			<p>Users run the web app by entering the domain name (e.g. facebook.com , gmail.com). When this happens, the browser connects to the server that is hosting the application and display whatever information it has received from the server.</p>
			<p>Web application grew in popularity because of the benefits it provides to both customers and service providers. For service providers, web applications allows central management of the application, easier and much cheaper upgrades, hardware independent among others. For customers, they can check out the services and avail it even when they are at their home.
			</p>
			<p>Most web apps, if not all, focuses on a web application that provides the best possible user interaction and user experience which eventually leads to more revenue. To make this happen, service providers thought that web apps must have a dynamic content.</p>

			<h3>Applets</h3>
			<p>Applets, one of the earliest attempts toward this goal, focused on using the client platform to deliver dynamic user experiences. At the same time, developers also investigated using the server platform for this purpose. Initially, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts were the main technology used to generate dynamic content. Although widely used, CGI scripting technology has a number of shortcomings, including platform dependence and lack of scalability. To address these limitations, Java Servlet technology was created as a portable way to provide dynamic, user-oriented content. </p>

			<h3>Java Servlets</h3>
			<p>
				A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers. For such applications, Java Servlet technology defines HTTP-specific servlet classes. </p>
			<p>Some functions of Java Servlets are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>handles client requests by generating responses to such requests.</li>
				<li> applications implemented on web servers.</li>
				<li>part of the Java Enterprise Edition (EE), which are used for transaction-based applications.
				</li>
				<li>hosted in a servlet container that provides the environment which the servlet runs, as well as controls the 'servlet lifecycle'.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes for writing servlets. All servlets must implement the Servlet interface, which defines life-cycle methods. When implementing a generic service, you can use or extend the GenericServlet class provided with the Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet class provides methods, such as doGet and doPost, for handling HTTP-specific services. </p>

			<h3>Servlet Lifecycle</h3>
			<div class="row">
				<p>
					Servlets, which are managed by a container, are used as web components to generate dynamic content. One function of containers (a.k.a servlet engines) is to manage the life cycle of a servlet.
				</p>
				<p>When a browser sends an HTTP request to the Web Server, the Web Server will send the request to the servlet container. From there, the servlet container will determine which servlet to invoke. When the servlet is done in processing the request, the servlet container ensures that response is properly flushed and then returns the control back to the Web server.
				</p>
				<div class="col-md">
					<br>The life cycle of a servlet has 4 stages (Java Servlet 3.1 (Java EE 7))
					<ol>
						<li>~ instantiation >> constructor call
							<br/> the constructor call -creates an instance of the servlet to service client requests -invoked implicitly by the servlet container when the servlet is called upon to service client request and no instance currently exists.
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li> ~ initialization >> init() method
							<br/> invoked only once intended for any startup init code
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li> ~ request handling >> service() method
							<br/> invoked for each client request performs whatever logic to serve request and generate response multi-threaded servlet instance; 'thread safe'
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>~ destruction >> destroy() method
							<br/> invoked before servlet instance is 'unloaded', housekeeping cleanup code.
						</li>
						<br/>
					</ol>

			<h3>HTTP Servlets</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>handles HTTP request and generates responses</li>
				<li>hosted in a web container, that takes cares of HTTP Requests conversion to HTTP Responses</li>
				<li>service() method call is routed to a doXXX() call</li>
			</ul>

			<p>doXXX calls are: doGet,doPost,doPut,doDelete,doTrace,doOptions,doHead</p>
			<p>the doXXX call requires two arguments</p>
			<ol>
				<li>HTTPServletRequest</li>
				<li> HTTPServletResponse</li>

			<h3>Java Server Pages</h3>
			<p>Java Server Pages, or JSP, is a Java view technology under Oracleâ€™s Java EE (Enterprise Edition) for web development. Compared to Java Servlets, which is comprised of HTML code within a Java program, JSP allows Java code to be inserted into HTML or XML pages. The codes can then be run to generate dynamic content embedded within web pages, as well as connect to external databases.
			</p>
			<p>Apache Tomcat and JDK (Java Software Development Kit) should be installed as they are required in order to run JSP.</p>
			<p>When a client sends a request over the internet, the web server compiles files with the .jsp extension, converting them into executable Java Servlets before serving or processing client HTTP requests. (Note: it first checks the page; if the page has already been compiled and has no modification from its last compilation, then conversion/compilation is not necessary.) This produces a document, like a HTML page, which is then handled like any other page or servlet and sent back to the client with a HTTP response.</p>
			<p>The <strong>jspInit()</strong> method is invoked to initialize external connections, like with databases or files, before running the servlet. The <strong>_jspService()</strong> method is invoked when there is a need for responding to HTTP requests. It dies with <strong>jspDestroy()</strong>.
